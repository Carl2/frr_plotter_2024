Write a README note on what the provided code does



* README

** Overview

The provided Python script, =main2.py=, processes and visualizes race data for riders across multiple stages of a competition. Utilizing libraries such as =pandas=, =numpy=, and =matplotlib=, it generates various plots representing riders' times, gaps, and positions.

** Key Features

1. *Data Parsing*:
   - Converts time strings (e.g., "1 hrs, 23 m 46.896 s") into =timedelta= objects for easier calculations.
   - Parses the riders' time gaps from strings (e.g., "+2 m 59.260 s") into =timedelta=.

2. *Data Handling*:
   - Groups data by rider name and stage, allowing for individual analyses and comparisons.

3. *Visualizations*:
   - Generates three types of plots saved as SVG files:
     - Rider Times (=plot_rider_times.svg=)
     - Rider Time Gaps (=plot_rider_egap.svg=)
     - Rider Positions (=plot_rider_pos.svg=)

** Usage

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:
   #+begin_src bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib icecream
   #+end_src

2. Run the script using Python:
   #+begin_src bash
   python main2.py
   #+end_src

3. The output SVG files will be saved in the current directory.

** Modifications

If you wish to process different race data, modify the =data= and =data_hdr= variables with your own data set.

** Conclusion

This script provides a comprehensive way to visualize competitive race data, making it easier to analyze rider performance across multiple stages.
